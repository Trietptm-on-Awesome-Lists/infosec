# What am I looking at?


### Note that the Files in Rev 1.1 may include lines 7 characters long, due to the newline duplicate issue.
This will be fixed in Rev 2.0

##  THESE ARE THE PASSWORDS, all INTENDED to be WPA Length.  
  * The lines in this folder were intended to be at 8-10 characters long - until Rev 2.0 they may include 7-character lines.
  * This is the format used by routers protected by WPA/2 security
  * Their length is in their title - same logic as for the main Real Passwords Folder
 
 * Note that these files are cumulative. I.E, the entirety of the smallest file is contained in the 2nd Smallest file. All of the smaller files are contained in the largest file.

### Torrents Folder
  * Contained within are torrents of the Real-Password-WPA Files
  * Four styles of compression are available LZMA-Zip, 7Z, tar.xz and tar.gz
  * After downloading, remember to seed to help others get the same access you did.
  * Mega.nz Links are also provided in the WPA-Length directory as a more predictable alternative to torrents
      
## Recommended Unarchivers:
* Windows: 7Zip
* Mac: Keka
* Linux: Command Line, p7zip

#### Recommended Torrent Client:
* __Deluge__ gave me the best results in terms of connecting to the seedbox
  
  
These are **REAL** passwords. Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet.
Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/
I've taken nearly all of the real passwords from these sites, combined them into a single list, removed duplicates and sorted by popularity. I couldn't find many lists that weren't sorted alphabetically - it seems like a dictionary attack should reflect actual human behavior as opposed to the alphabet.

### NOTE THAT FOR THIS FIRST VERSION, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename
